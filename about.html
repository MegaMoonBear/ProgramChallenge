    <h1>Meghan's About - Intro, Aspirations, and Nummies</h1>
    <!-- Replace the InnerHTML text below with what is being asked for -->
    <p>Meghan is a 53 year old with over 20 years of experience in analytics across numerous career fields. She wants to upskill to become a Data Scientist by learning to code. She is most familiar with SQL for analysis and creating repeatable SOP. She's slightly interested in "pandas" since she used to work with the live ones. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Meghan would also consider using her other experiences and skills.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Meghan's favorite comfort food is pizza. (But her favorite type is Japanese, since she lived there for 3.5 years... a LONG time ago.) </p>
