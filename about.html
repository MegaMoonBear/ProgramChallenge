    <p>Meghan is a 53 year old with over 20 years of experience in analytics across numerous career fields. She wants to upskill to become a Data Scientist by learning to code. She is most familiar with SQL for analysis and creating repeatable SOP. She's also a bit interested in "pandas" since she used to work with the live ones. </p>
    <p>Meghan would also consider using her other experiences and skills.</p>
    <p>Meghan's favorite comfort food is pizza. (But her favorite type is Japanese, since she lived there for 3.5 years... a LONG time ago.) </p>
